## Implementation Status

### Completed Tasks

- ✅ Consolidated 87 individual tools into 6 bucket tools
- ✅ Renamed bucket tools with user-friendly names:
  - `legislation_hub` (unchanged)
  - `members_and_committees` (renamed from people_relationships_hub)
  - `voting_and_nominations` (renamed from voting_political_hub)
  - `records_and_hearings` (renamed from records_communications_hub)
  - `committee_intelligence` (renamed from committee_intelligence_hub)
  - `research_and_professional` (renamed from research_professional_hub)
- ✅ Updated all internal references and imports
- ✅ Implemented tier-based access control for all operations
- ✅ Tested all bucket tools with both free and paid operations
- ✅ Verified error handling and logging consistency

### Next Steps

- Remove `@mcp.tool` decorators from individual tools to complete deregistration
- Remove individual tool imports from `main.py` to avoid duplicate registration
- Update client documentation to reflect new bucket tool names
- Monitor error logs for any unexpected issues after migration
- **Value**: AI insights, custom integrations, consulting services

## Implementation Architecture

### Technical Approach

#### Phase 1: Delegation Layer
```python
@mcp.tool("legislation_hub")
async def legislation_hub(
    ctx: Context,
    operation: str,
    **kwargs
) -> str:
    # Route to appropriate internal function based on operation
    if operation == "search_bills":
        return await _search_bills(ctx, **kwargs)
    elif operation == "get_bill_details":
        return await _get_bill_details(ctx, **kwargs)
    # etc.
```

#### Phase 2: Internal Function Conversion
- Convert existing `@mcp.tool` functions to internal `_function_name()` methods
- Preserve all reliability framework components
- Maintain parameter validation and error handling
- Keep existing function signatures and behaviors

#### Phase 3: Tier-Based Access Control
```python
@mcp.tool("voting_and_nominations")
async def voting_and_nominations(ctx: Context, operation: str, **kwargs) -> str:
    # Check tier-based access at operation level
    if operation not in FREE_OPERATIONS:
        # Verify user has paid access
        if not ctx.tier or ctx.tier == "free":
            raise ToolError("Access denied: This tool requires a paid subscription (Pro or Enterprise). Your current tier: Free. Please upgrade your subscription to access this feature.")
    
    # Route to appropriate internal function
    return await route_voting_and_nominations_operation(ctx, operation, **kwargs)
```

#### Phase 4: Parameter Schema Design
- Unified parameter validation per bucket
- Operation-specific parameter requirements
- Clear error messages for invalid combinations
- Backward compatibility with existing patterns

### Migration Strategy

1. **Week 1-2**: Implement delegation layer and internal routing
2. **Week 3**: Comprehensive testing and parameter validation  
3. **Week 4**: Deploy alongside existing tools for A/B testing
4. **Week 5-6**: Gather feedback and iterate on design
5. **Week 7**: Full migration with deprecation of individual tools
